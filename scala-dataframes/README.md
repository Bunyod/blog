# Scala data tables and frames

Code samples associated with my blog post "Scala data frames and tables" which can be found at:

https://darrenjw.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/data-frames-and-tables-in-scala/

See the post for explanation of the examples.

Note that you must run the script r/gen-csv.R in an R session FIRST, in order to generate the CSV file required for the Scala examples.
