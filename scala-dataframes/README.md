# Scala data tables and frames

Code samples associated with my blog post "Scala data frames and tables" currently in prep. I'll link to it here once it's posted.

Note that you must run the script r/gen-csv.R in an R session FIRST, in order to generate the CSV file required for the Scala examples.
